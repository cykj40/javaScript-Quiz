# javaScript-Quiz
#Description: I created a Javascript quiz using html, css and Javascript. I started with a homepage which you can start the game or navigate to the highscores page. When you click the start button the quiz automatically begins. You are given 5:00 to complete the quiz if you do not complete the quiz in the 5:00 given you will be given a message that you are out of time and you will be redirected to the end page. If you are able to complete the quiz you will be redirected to the end page where you can save your score. You could view the high scores or you could play again. Here is a preview.
